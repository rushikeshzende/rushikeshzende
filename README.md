# 👋 Hi, I'm Rushikesh Zende

**AI Engineer | Applied Machine Learning & Deep Learning | Intelligent Systems Architect**

I design and build end-to-end AI systems that learn from data, adapt to real-world complexity, and deliver measurable impact. My work spans machine learning, deep learning, and full-stack system integration—turning raw ideas into production-ready intelligence.

## 🚀 About Me

It started with a simple question:

**"What if machines could learn the way I do—by building, breaking, and iterating?"**

That curiosity evolved into a craft. I now focus on architecting intelligent systems—from data pipelines and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and deployment. My projects explore how AI can move beyond experiments and operate reliably in real environments. I've worked on:

- Vision systems that interpret patterns humans miss
- Predictive models that reduce uncertainty in dynamic domains
- Decision-support systems for healthcare and agriculture

I'm not just training models—I'm building **capability**.
